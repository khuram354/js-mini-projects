/*
This CSS file with a simple animation that moves a `<span>` element from its initial position to a different position while fading it out. The `@keyframes` rule defines the animation behavior, and the `.animate` animation is applied to the `<span>` element.

Here's a breakdown of what each part of CSS does:

1. The `body` rule sets some basic styles for the entire document, such as removing margins and padding and setting the background color to black.

2. The `span` rule styles a `<span>` element. It sets a background image, dimensions, disables pointer events, and positions it absolutely in the center of its containing element using `left: 50%`, `top: 50%`, and `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)`.

3. The `@keyframes animate` rule defines the animation behavior. It starts with the element in its original position and fully opaque (opacity: 1) at 0% of the animation duration, and then moves it upward by 5000% of its height while simultaneously fading it out (opacity: 0) at 100% of the animation duration.

Overall, this CSS file creates a simple animation where an element moves upwards and fades out over a duration of 6 seconds.
